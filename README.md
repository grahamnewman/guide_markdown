## Archanawat style guide | writing
Initial commit 11 October

- Concrete and simple.
- Short sentences.
- Use short common words of the English language that everybody knows.
- People should be at the heart of the sentence.
- Avoid metaphors and cliches.
- Active sentences.
- Hit the full stop button as often as you can.

What are your audience's needs? Earn their time and attention that you can see in your mind's eye.
Less of a chore, more pleasurable.

Avoid abstractions, cliches and twisted vocabulary.

Be honest with the audience:
- Clarity.
- Brevity.
- Simplicity.
- Creativity.

Avoid the language of academics. Use ordinary speech.

- Write the storyline.
- Edit the storyline.
- Publish the storyline.

Full stops and short sentences. Avoid semicolons at all costs.

Avoid hopefully, prestigious, iconic, get, key, major. They are overused.

Don't be formulaic with writing style. Be original and clear.

Don't use phrasings of the industry insiders and the overall in-group jargon.

Simplify things all the time.

Try to avoid starting a sentence with yet or but.

Originality is the premium. Come up with headlines and captions that are original.

Write to make your reader smile.
